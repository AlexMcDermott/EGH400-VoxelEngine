# Voxel Renderer

This repository houses both the code and reports for my final year engineering thesis where I created a voxel rendering engine. You can you view the [full report here](https://github.com/AlexMcDermott/EGH400-VoxelEngine/blob/4cdd813552a0a7d2fa1ee3691a86a95b143828b7/assessment/Delivery/Delivery%20Report.pdf) as well as [live app hosted with GitHub Pages here](https://alexmcdermott.github.io/EGH400-VoxelEngine/).
